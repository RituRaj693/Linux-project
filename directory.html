<h1>pwd</h1>
<h2>pwd stands for present working Directory</h2>
<p>
pwd commands use for to see in which directory the current user is present.
<h1>Cd</h1>
<h2>Cd stands for changing Directory</h2>
You can change your current directory with the cd command (Change Directory)
<h1>cd ..</h1>
To go to the parent directory (the one just above your current directory in the directory tree), type cd .. .
<h1> absolute and relative paths</h2>
You should be aware of absolute and relative paths in the file tree. When you type a path starting with a slash (/), then the root of the file tree is assumed. If you don't start your path with a slash, then the current directory is the assumed starting point.
The screenshot below first shows the current directory /home/paul. From within this directory, you have to type cd /home instead of cd home to go to the /home directory.
<h1> mkdir</h1>
Walking around the Unix file tree is fun, but it is even more fun to create your own directories with mkdir. You have to give at least one parameter to mkdir, the name of the new directory to be created. Think before you type a leading / 
<h1> rmdir</h1>
When a directory is empty, you can use rmdir to remove the directory.
<h1> rmdir -p and mkdir -p </h1>
And similar to the mkdir -p option, you can also use rmdir to recursively remove directories.
