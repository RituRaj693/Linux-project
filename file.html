<h1> all files are case sensitive</h1>
<p>
Files on Linux (or any Unix) are case sensitive. This means that FILE1 is different from file1, and /etc/hosts is different from /etc/Hosts (the latter one does not exist on a typical Linux computer).
<h1> touch</h1>
<h2> create an empty file</h2>
One easy way to create an empty file is with touch command
<h1>cat </h1>
cat command is use to display the content of the file 
<h1> rm </h1>
<h2> remove forever </h2>
When you no longer need a file, use rm to remove it. Unlike some graphical user interfaces, the command line in general does not have a waste bin or trash can to recover files. When you use rm to remove a file, the file is gone. Therefore, be careful when removing files!

<h1> rm -i</h1>
To prevent yourself from accidentally removing a file, you can type rm -i
<h1> cp </h2>
<h2> copy one file </h2>
To copy a file, use cp with a source and a target argument
 <h1>mv</h1>
<h2> rename files with mv </h2>
Use mv to rename a file or to move the file to another directory.
<h1> rename directories with mv </h1>
The same mv command can be used to rename directories
<h1> mv -i </h1>
The mv also has a -i switch similar to cp and rm.
